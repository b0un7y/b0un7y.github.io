An appropriate question. Especially for someone who does so much programming all the time. And even more so for someone who does so much work with website. I should be used to more complex website designs and intricately flowing UI/UX. Of course I am. That's why I hate it. It feels like a waste or resources and CPU power. Every time I open a website such as Facebook (God forbid the (((zucc))) getting his hands on my data), my CPU starts frying, and the fans begin to go insane. It's frankly unacceptable for websites to take such a load, especially when they realistically don't need it. Every phone app update is in the ranges of 100 to 500MB. What the fuck is in these updates. Just more ways to track you.

Hence why I have opted for a barebones approach to my website. I don't want anything to be amiss here. And I want people to feel safe. It's old school, barely has any CSS, but it does the job. This is driving a Hilux, while other blogs are all driving the latest Tesla. Unless you need to prove that your dick is bigger than mine (which is probably is), then there's no point for the wiz-bang poetry.
