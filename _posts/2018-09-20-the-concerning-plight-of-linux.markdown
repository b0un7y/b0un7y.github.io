I love Linux. It runs many of my machines at home and remote. I use it every day for both general use, but also for dev and pen testing. It's not only an intergral part of my life, but also a part of the open source community. The most recent travesty that has befallen our community (because that's what we are) is of major concern. Not because of it's acute remifications, but rather the slow bleed it will cause in the long term. I fear for the open source community as a consequence.

Linus is not just a smart man, I firmly believe he is a good man. He has altruism at his heart, even though he doesn't express it in the same way that we expect. While I do not believe he is diagnosed with autism, it's fairly clear that he sits somewhere on that spectrum (don't we all though). His way of expressing his thoughts is his own. I personally like it, but I understand people who can't handle it.

Linux was not built on shortcuts however. It was built on stringent rules that required following. Just read Linus' coding guidelines for Linux. It's actually somewhat beautiful. I follow them (particularly the crap about 8 space indents). But that's besides the point.

The issue lies in the overly vocal horde of SJWs who's only goal is to infiltrate, overrun and eventually maim well functioning communities that do not bow to their ideals. We can't even call them cunts. Because that becomes a hate crime. But that's exactly what they are. Cunts.

If you can't take it, don't bother giving it. I'm sure linux has missed out on incredibly lines of code because of people too scared to face the reality that their improvements are in actual reality quite shit. This is Linus' project. Just accept that you need to do things the way that he wants. With his guidance and brilliantly intelligent touch, Linux has become the largest operating system on the planet. I'm just proud to be a part of it, and so should every involved in my opinion. Let him be himself. Let the community continue the way it's continuing.

I'm worried that this event will lead on the path that Mozilla took, another great beacon of the open-source community. Sure there are great alternatives to everything, but I don't want the alternatives. I want Linux. I don't want Aldi Coke, I want Coca-Cola.

It's sad to see someone I consider a great man to be brought down but a small yet vocal minority of people who can't handle being told that they are wrong. I get told it all the time, most often by myself. Accept it and grow up.
